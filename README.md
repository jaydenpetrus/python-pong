# Pong: The Python Version

## Description

This is my take on the original Pong using Python and the Turtle graphics package. 
It's a local multiplayer version so you can play this with a friend!
This project utilizes an Object Oriented Paradigm using a variety of classes, objects, and class inheritance.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Make sure to fork over all files and then run main.py file to begin the game. 
Everything else needed to run the game is included in the other files so make sure you have them all. 

### Controls 

Player 1: Use 'W' to go up and 'S' to go down.
Player 2: Use the 'Up' arrow key to go up and the 'Down' arrow key to go down.
